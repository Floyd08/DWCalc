# DWCalc
A hostable damage calculator for FFG's Deathwatch RPG

Wondering how to host this? Me too! Watch this space for instructions:
- DWDeploy contains all dependencies, so you can simply unzip and run. As for hosting, I'll get back to you

You can set the username and password with command line arguments. For example:

node app.js admin password

will set the username to: Admin and the password to: password (Please don't use password)
